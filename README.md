Fanuc G-Code engraving app

Finally functional!
Currently the program exists in io_window.py.
Running this with required dependencies like tkinter
will open the application, where the user enters parameters 
like character height, feedrates etc.
This relies on the Subprograms that have to be installed on your
CNC control, and likely they only work on a control that supports
Fanuc Macro-B.

Happy to take constructive criticism.
This is my first project so don't be a dick.
